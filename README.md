# ask-your-datasheet

Give to the tool the datasheet you want to understand and ask him questions on how to configure and use the peripheral.

## Vision

As user, you start the `ask-your-datasheet` with a link to the datasheet. After the tool has started, you can ask questions such as: How should I configure my SPI to communicate with my sensors...

## Architecture

TBD

## Warning

This is first a project to understand how LLM is working and how I can build complex solutions out of it
